# KiraraProject

## Requirements

- GCC 11.4 or higher
- Clang 16.0 or higher (18.0 or higher recommended)
- MSVC 17.8 (19.38) or higher

## Subprojects

- **KIRA**: A minimum and high-performance shared graphics infrastructure.
- **FLux-v2**(WIP): A KIRA's port of our previous offline rendering engine.
- **Kirara Dance**(WIP): An effect-oriented animation and simulation engine.

## Build

KIRA is designed to be built out-of-box, while others are only built with
best-effort guarantee. That is to say, some special dependencies are to be setup
on your own.
